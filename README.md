# Diamonds
Supervised ML - Regression

For this project, I'll be using the 'diamonds' dataset from seaborn, which contains information on diamond prices and their attributes, such as carat, cut, color, and clarity. My goal will be to predict the price of a diamond based on these attributes. Here is its information more in detail:

**price**: price in US dollars ($326–$18,823)

**carat:** weight of the diamond (0.2–5.01)

**cut:** quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

**color:** diamond colour, from D (best) to J (worst)

**clarity:** a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

**x:** length in mm (0–10.74)

**y:** width in mm (0–58.9)

**z:** depth in mm (0–31.8)

**depth**: total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43–79)

**table:** width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43–95)
